The IG is not for the international realm, and it uses SNOMED CT, so it should fix the SCT edition in the expansion parameters
# Terminology assets not found in tx

# no mixed FSN and preferred terms
This SNOMED-CT based include has some concepts with semantic tags (FSN terms) and some without (preferred terms) - check that this is what is intended (examples for FSN: [Hospital admission, by legal authority (commitment)] and examples for no FSN: [Voluntary admission, Involuntary admission, Involuntary hospital admission])
