The extensions implementation guide is a package for all extensions specified by HL7 Europe for the EU realm. This includes extensions defined for guides like 
- HL7 Europe Laboratory Report  
- HL7 Europe Medication Prescription and Dispense  
- HL7 Europe Hospital Discharge Report  
- HL7 Europe Imaging Study Report
- HL7 Europe European Patient Summary  
- HL7 Europe Base  
- etc

The implementation guide has R4 and R5 versions. For extensions defined in both versions, the content is expected to be conceptually the same (technical differences may appear due to new data types or resources). 
For various reasons, the need for an extension may apply only for R4 or R5. In this case, extension is only defined in one version.
