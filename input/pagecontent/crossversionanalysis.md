### R4 vs R5 IG

This implementation guide has parallel flavours for HL7 FHIR R4 and R5 versions. 

R4 extensions replicating IHE extensions defined in R5, carry the same canonical URL despite being technically published by HL7 Europe.  

Some example value sets differ between versions due to the value set being only available for R4.  (International Patient Summary) or only in R5 (IHE MPD extensions may use FHIR R5 core value sets).
